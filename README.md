[Auth0](https://auth0.com) Lock Passwordless is a professional looking dialog that allows users to log in by receiving a one-time password via email or text message. It also supports social providers.

This library has been designed to work in a browser. Lock libraries for [iOS](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX) and [Android](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.Android) which support passwordless authentication are also available.

## Playground

You can try it out yourself online at the [playground](https://auth0.github.io/lock-passwordless/).

## Usage

To send a one-time password via text message you initialize a new `Auth0LockPasswordless` object and invoke the `sms` method.

```javascript
var clientID = "YOUR_AUTH0_APP_CLIENTID";
var domain = "YOUR_DOMAIN_AT.auth0.com";
document.getElementById("loginButton").onclick = function(e) {
  var lock = new Auth0LockPasswordless(clientID, domain);
  lock.sms(function(error, profile, id_token) {
    // This will be invoked when the user enters the one-time password he or she
    // received via text message. Here we just welcome the user, but usually you
    // want save the profile and id_token, and handle errors.
    if (!error) {
      alert("Hi " + profile.name);
    }
  });
};
```

You can also send the user a _magic link_ by invoking the `magiclink` method instead.

```javascript
var clientID = "YOUR_AUTH0_APP_CLIENTID";
var domain = "YOUR_DOMAIN_AT.auth0.com";
document.getElementById("loginButton").onclick = function(e) {
  var lock = new Auth0LockPasswordless(clientID, domain);
  lock.magiclink();
};
```

Once the user receives the email and clicks on this link, Auth0 will handle the authentication and redirect back to the application with the token as the hash location. You can parse the hash and retrieve the full user profile.

```js
// parse hash on page load
$(document).ready(function(){
  var hash = lock.parseHash(window.location.hash);

  if (hash && hash.error) {
    alert('There was an error: ' + hash.error + '\n' + hash.error_description);
  } else if (hash && hash.id_token) {
    //use id_token for retrieving profile.
    localStorage.setItem('id_token', hash.id_token);
    //retrieve profile
    lock.getProfile(hash.id_token, function (err, profile) {
      if (err){
        //handle err
      } else {
        //use user profile
      }
    });
  }
});
```

// invoke logout with query parameters
lock.logout({ref: window.location.href});
```

### Customization

The appearance of the widget and the mechanics of authentication can be customized with an `options` object which has one or more of the following properties. Each method that opens the dialog can take an `options` object as its first argument.

#### UI options

- **autoclose {Boolean}**: Determines whether or not the Lock will be closed automatically after a successful sign in. If the Lock is not `closable` it won't be closed even if this option is set to `true`. Defaults to `false`.
- **connections {Array}**: List of social providers that will be available to perform the authentication. Most of the time you will specify a provider with the connection name, e.g. `facebook`. When the connection's `name` and `strategy` don't match, you'll need to provide an object with those properties, e.g. `{name: "my-connection", strategy: "facebook"}`.  This option doesn't have a default value and must be specified when opening the Lock with a method that provides social authentication.
- **container {String}**: The `id` of the html element where the Lock will be rendered. This makes the Lock appear inline instead of in a modal window.
- **dict {Object}**: Allows to customize every piece of text displayed in the Lock. Defaults to `{}`. See below [Dict Specification](#dict-specification) for the details.
- **icon {String}**: Url for an image that will be placed in the Lock's header. Defaults to Auth0's logo.
- **closable {Boolean}**: Determines whether or not the Lock can be closed. When a `container` option is provided its value is always `false`, otherwise it defaults to `true`.
- **defaultLocation {String}**: [ISO country code](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes) of the country that will be selected by default when entering a phone number. Defaults to the country the user is in and fallback to `"US"` when it can't be obtained.
- **focusInput {Boolean}**: Determines whether or not the first input on the screen, that is the email or phone number input, should have focus when the Lock is displayed. Defaults to `false` when a `container` option is provided or the Lock is being render on a mobile device. Otherwise it defaults to `true`.
- **gravatar {Boolean}**: Determines whether or not Gravatar images and user names should be displayed on the Lock's header once an email has been entered. Defaults to `true`.
- **popup {Boolean}**: Determines whether or not a popup is shown when authenticating with a social provider. Defaults to `false` and passing `true` is discouraged. See [below](#popup-mode) for more information.
- **popupOptions {Object}**: Allows to customize the location of the popup in the screen. Any [position and size feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#Position_and_size_features) allowed by `window.open` is accepted. Defaults to `{}`.
- **primaryColor {String}**: Defines the primary color of the Lock, all colors used in the widget will be calculated from it. This option is useful when providing a custom `icon` to ensure all colors go well together with the icon's color palette. Defaults to `"#ea5323"`.
- **rememberLastLogin {Boolean}**: Determines whether or not the email or the phone number will be filled automatically with the one you used the last time. Defaults to `true`.
- **socialBigButtons {Boolean}**: Determines the size of the buttons for the social providers specified in the `connections` option. It defaults to `true` when the `connections` option contains at most tree providers, otherwise it defaults to `false`.

#### Authentication options

- **authParams {Object}**: Specifies extra parameters that will be sent when starting a login. Defaults to `{}`.
- **callbackURL {String}**: The url Auth0 will redirect back after authentication. When provided it will enable redirect mode. Defaults to the empty string `""` (no callback URL).
- **forceJSONP {Boolean}**: Force JSONP requests for all requests to Auth0. This setup is useful when no CORS allowed. Defaults to `false`.
- **responseType {String}**:  Should be set to `"token"` for Single Page Applications, and `"code"` otherwise. Defaults to `"code"` when `callbackURL` is provided, and to `"token"` otherwise.

#### Other options

- **disableWarnings {Boolean}**: Determines whether or not warning messages will be output to the browser's console. Defaults to `false`.

#### Example

```js
var options = {
  container: "myContainer",
  icon: "/path/to/my/icon.png",
  closable: false,
  dict: {title: "My Company"},
  focusInput: false,
  gravatar: false
};
```

#### Dict Specification

A dict, short for dictionary, is an object that contains every piece of text the Lock needs to display. Different textual components are needed depending on what method you called to open the Lock. The following is an example of the dict used when the Lock is opened with the `emailcode` method:

```js
{
  code: {
    codeInputPlaceholder: "Your code",
    footerText: "",
    headerText: "Please check your email ({email})<br />You've received a message from us<br />with your passcode."
  },
  confirmation: {
    success: "Thanks for signing in."
  },
  email: {
    emailInputPlaceholder: "yours@example.com",
    footerText: "",
    headerText: "Enter your email to sign in or sign up."
  },
  title: "Auth0",
  welcome: "Welcome {name}!"
}
```

When you open the Lock with `emailcode` or any other method available, you can override any value by providing a [dict option](#ui-options).

```js
lock.emailcode({
  email: {
    footerText: "You must agree to our <a href='/terms' target='_new'>terms of service</a>"
  },
  title: "My Company"
});
```

The previous code will change the title displayed in the header and will display a footer when the Lock is asking the user for the email.

As you can see from the examples, some keys are _namespaced_ inside another object and some are not. In the first case, they are only used in a given screen, while in the latter can be used from any screen. Also, most of the values accept HTML tags. The exception are the the ones used as input placeholders. Finally, some strings can be interpolated, which means that they contain a placeholder which will be replaced before being displayed. For instance:

```js
lock.emailcode({
  code: {
    headerText: "The code has been sent to {email}"
  }
});
```

Will cause the Lock to show the message _"The code has been sent to someone@auth0.com"_ when asking for the verification code to a user that entered the email _"someone@auth0.com"_.

You can check the [source code](src/dict/dicts.js) to see the actual dictionaries used by the Lock.

### Popup mode

A popup window can be displayed instead of redirecting the user to a social provider website. While this has the advantage of preserving page state, it has some issues. Often times users have popup blockers that prevent the login page from even displaying. There are also known issues with mobile browsers. For example, in recent versions of Chrome on iOS, the login popup does not get [closed properly](https://github.com/auth0/lock/issues/71) after login. For these reasons, we encourage developers to avoid this mode, even with Single Page Apps.

If you nevertheless decide to use it, you can activate popup mode by passing the option `popup: true` when calling `social`, `socialOrMagiclink`, `socialOrEmailcode`, or `socialOrSms`. A callback will be invoked with the usual arguments as the following example shows.

```js
lock.social({
  connections: ["facebook", "twitter"],
  popup: true
}, function(error, profile, id_token, access_token, state, refresh_token) {
  if (!error) {
    alert("User has logged in");
  }
});
```


More information can be found in [Auth0's documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/authentication-modes#popup-mode).

### Callbacks and Errors

 As a rule of thumb, all callbacks passed to a method that opens the Lock are invoked when the job of the Lock can be considered done. The first argument of the callback is reserved for an error object. If an error occurred, the callback will be invoked with just the error object. If no error occurred, the callback will be invoked with `null` as the first argument, followed by any number of arguments it needs.

 All error objects have an `error` and a `description` property. The first will contain a synthetic code used to identify the error, and the later will contain a more readable description. They may contain other useful properties according to the situation.

 See each method's documentation for the specifics.

## Browser Compatibility

We ensure browser compatibility in Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE >= 10. We currently use [zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul) along with [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com) to run integration tests on each push.

## Contributing

Clone the repo and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Changes to the source code will be automatically rebuilt. To see the result, point your favorite browser to [http://localhost:3000/playground/](http://localhost:3000/playground/).

However, testing changes that way can be cumbersome because there are HTTP request involved which are being rate-limited. If your changes are scoped to the UI, you will be better off running:

```
npm run design
```

And pointing your browser to [http://localhost:3000/design/](http://localhost:3000/design/). It behaves just like `npm start` but requests to the [Auth0](https://auth0.com) API will be simulated.


### Running the tests

Tests can be run in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) or in a web browser with the following commands:

```
npm run test:phantom
npm run test:browser
```

### Releasing a new version

Whenever a new commit is pushed to _master_, the CI will attempt to deploy a new release to [Github](https://github.com) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) if the tests pass and there isn't already a release for the version specified in the [package.json](package.json) file. See [bin/deploy](bin/deploy) for the details.

There is also a convenient [script](bin/version) to prepare a new release:

```
bin/version {patch,minor,major}
```
